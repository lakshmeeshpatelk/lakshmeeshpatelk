## Hi there 👋
#  I'm Lakshmeesh

🤖I’m a recent grad and a  full stack developer working primarily with JavaScript and Python.  
I build web applications end to end, using React for the frontend and Node.js for backend services, with experience designing and working with both SQL and MongoDB databases.

I’m comfortable with my current stack and continue to improve it by shipping real projects, making better architectural decisions, and refining code quality through iteration.

Alongside this, I’m actively learning TypeScript and NestJS to write more maintainable, type-safe, and scalable backend systems.

🖥 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Python  
- **Databases:** SQL, MongoDB  
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub  
- **Currently Learning:** TypeScript, NestJS

⌛️ Current Focus
- Building and maintaining full stack applications
- Designing clean APIs and backend workflows
- Improving data handling and application structure
- Incrementally adopting TypeScript in production-style code

🛠 Projects
My projects are documented here on GitHub.  
Each repository represents hands-on learning through building, refactoring, and improvement.
